### Overview
Our group is creating a reviewing website. Whether it is toilet papers, hotels, venues, movies, books, services, websites, petting zoos, or anything else under the sun; our site allows you to research it, rate it, and share your experiences. By expanding our site to all items, rather than a specific or niche group, the reviewer and user experience takes precedence over the items in question. Easily get recommendations from people you trust, while avoiding inflated views from advertisers and algorithms.
